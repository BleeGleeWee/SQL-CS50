# 😱 Week 3 — Don't Panic

This folder contains my solution to the **“Don't Panic”** problem set from **Week 3** of [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/).

Inspired by *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, this challenge involves hacking into a fictional alien system and modifying database records to disrupt their plans — using advanced SQL queries.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Subqueries within `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM`
- Use of `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, and `IN`
- Modifying data with `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT`
- Joins across multiple tables to track interstellar threats
- Thoughtful use of logic to find hidden patterns and vulnerabilities

---

## 🌌 Mission Goals

- Intercept and manipulate alien fleet control data
- Use subqueries to identify vulnerabilities in their system
- Alter critical rows to disrupt their attack (ethically 😄)

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
2. Load `dont-panic.db`
3. Run `hack.sql` to perform the operations
4. If needed, run `reset.sql` to restore the original data
