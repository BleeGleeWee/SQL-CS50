# 🤖 Week 0 — CyberChase

This folder contains my solutions to the **“CyberChase”** problem set from **Week 0** of [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/).

The challenge involves writing queries to explore and analyze a fictional database of characters and events from the "CyberChase" universe.

## 📁 Files Overview

Each `.sql` file contains a solution to a specific query-based task. The queries operate on `cyberchase.db`, which includes data on characters, locations, episodes, and their interactions.

| File      | Description (Problem #)               |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| `1.sql`   | Retrieve all characters                |
| `2.sql`   | Count characters per location          |
| `3.sql`   | Find characters with specific traits   |
| `4.sql`   | Episode appearance count               |
| `5.sql`   | Filter characters by origin            |
| `6.sql`   | Query for popular locations            |
| `7.sql`   | Find villains with most appearances    |
| `8.sql`   | Select episodes from specific seasons  |
| `9.sql`   | Match characters by episode themes     |
| `10.sql`  | Count recurring character pairs        |
| `11.sql`  | Identify underused locations           |
| `12.sql`  | Find characters that never appeared    |
| `13.sql`  | Bonus: Complex multi-table query       |

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Practiced

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `DISTINCT`
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- Filtering with conditions and wildcards
- Sorting and grouping with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`
- Subqueries and nested logic
- Multi-table querying and JOINs

---

## 🗃️ Database

- **File**: `cyberchase.db`
- Format: SQLite
- Tables include: `characters`, `episodes`, `appearances`, `locations`, etc.

> ✅ You can explore the schema using [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to better understand the relationships before running queries.
