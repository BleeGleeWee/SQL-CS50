# ⚽ Week 0 — Players

This folder includes SQL solutions to the **“Players”** problem set from **Week 0** of [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/).

You’ll work with `players.db`, a fictional sports-related database, to explore player stats, teams, and performance using basic SQL queries.
