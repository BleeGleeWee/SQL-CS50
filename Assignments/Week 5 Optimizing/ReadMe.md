# 🚀 Week 5 — Optimizing

This folder contains my solutions for **Week 5** of [CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/), which focuses on **query performance optimization** using indexes and analytical tools.

This week’s goal is to explore how to make SQL queries run faster on large datasets, reduce redundancy, and understand query execution flow using `EXPLAIN`.

## 📁 Problem Sets

### 📷 Snap
- Analyze a large-scale social media-style platform.
- Identify slow queries and use `EXPLAIN` to understand execution.
- Apply indexing strategies to optimize data retrieval.

### 🎓 Harvard
- Optimize real-world data from a university catalog.
- Improve the speed of queries involving courses, departments, and instructors.
- Explore composite indexes and query plan analysis.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Using `CREATE INDEX` to speed up filtering and joins  
- Identifying redundant or inefficient queries  
- Analyzing execution plans using `EXPLAIN`  
- Understanding table scans, index usage, and join performance  
- Query rewriting for optimal execution

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQLite  
- DB Browser for SQLite  
- `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`

---

## 💡 Optimization Goals

- Reduce query runtime  
- Minimize full-table scans  
- Maximize index hits  
- Maintain query correctness while boosting performance
