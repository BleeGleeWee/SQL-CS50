# 💞 Week 6 — Happy to Connect (Sentimental)

This folder contains my solution to the **“Happy to Connect (Sentimental)”** project from **Week 6** of [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/).

The project explores the design of a **scalable matchmaking or connection system**, simulating how relationships or user preferences can be stored, managed, and queried efficiently — with a sentimental twist.

## 💡 Project Summary

This database is designed to:

- Capture **user profiles**, attributes, and preferences  
- Store **relationship data**, including emotional parameters  
- Provide a scalable way to suggest or connect users based on logic  
- Model meaningful, sentiment-aware connections at scale

It’s a creative blend of database design and social logic, imagining how emotional or qualitative traits can be embedded into structured data.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Scalable schema design with normalized relationships  
- Use of `FOREIGN KEY`, `PRIMARY KEY`, and table linking  
- Conceptual modeling of sentiment or emotion in SQL  
- Query planning for efficient matching or recommendations

---

## 📐 Schema Overview

Key tables (based on `schema.sql`) may include:

- `users` — stores core profile information  
- `connections` — tracks relationship status and scores  
- `traits` or `preferences` — maps user emotional/interest profiles  

This schema is meant to support growth, flexibility, and logical querying.

---

## 🚀 Possible Extensions

- Add Python scripting to simulate connection suggestions  
- Implement triggers to update relationship status dynamically  
- Extend schema with AI-simulated compatibility scores
