# 🧬 Week 6 — Scaling

This folder contains my submissions for **Week 6** of [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/), which focuses on **scaling database-backed applications** by integrating SQL with external programming environments (e.g., Python) and improving architecture for larger datasets.

This final week blends SQL skills with scripting and system design, simulating real-world scalable application practices.
