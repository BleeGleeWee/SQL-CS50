# 🧠 Week 6 — Deep

This folder contains my solution to the **“Deep”** challenge from **Week 6** of [CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/).

This task focuses on diving **deep into multi-layered data relationships**, encouraging scalable thinking about how deeply nested or abstracted data can be structured, analyzed, and queried.

## 💡 Project Summary

While not code-heavy, this assignment is conceptually deep. It tests your understanding of:

- Relational depth  
- Logical structuring of data  
- Conceptual scalability in SQL systems  
- Thinking beyond tables: modeling abstract ideas relationally

The task may include theoretical questions or schema design challenges, pushing your ability to plan complex systems.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Abstract modeling in relational databases  
- Identifying scalability bottlenecks in schema design  
- Understanding nested relationships and recursive structures  
- Reflecting on what “depth” means in data

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- Designing complex systems like organizational hierarchies, file trees, or biological taxonomies  
- Building for scalability and clarity in data representation  
- Planning beyond immediate SQL syntax into system thinking
