# ⚾ Week 1 — Moneyball

This folder contains my SQL solutions for the **"Moneyball"** problem set from **Week 1** of [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/).

In this challenge, we analyze baseball team and player performance data using multi-table relational queries to simulate the data-driven strategies made famous by the “Moneyball” approach.

> 📦 Note: The `.db` database file is removed as done in other folders, use your local copy from the course to run the queries.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Multi-table `JOIN`s and foreign key relationships
- Aggregation: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `HAVING`
- Sorting and ranking with `ORDER BY`
- Applying sports analytics to structured data

---

## ✅ Goal

Understand how to query and analyze performance data across multiple tables — similar to how teams use data science in real-world sports management.
