This folder contains solutions for **Week 2** of [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/), focused on **database design principles**.

In this week’s assignments, the emphasis shifts from querying to *creating schemas* using proper table structures, data types, primary keys, and foreign key constraints.
